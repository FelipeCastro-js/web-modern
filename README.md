# 🚀 Digital Marketing Agency — UI Showcase & Practice Project

Welcome to a vibrant and modern **Digital Marketing Agency** interface built to showcase creativity, responsiveness, and animation finesse. This project simulates a real-world agency website, featuring:

- ✨ Bold headlines and engaging copy
- 🎨 Cartoon-style illustrations and clean layouts
- 📱 Responsive pricing cards and interactive buttons
- 📊 Social media integration and brand messaging

Everything is designed to reflect the energy and professionalism of a real agency — but with one key twist:

> **This is a practice project built to explore and master modern web development tools.**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project was crafted using:

- **Next.js** — for fast, scalable React-based development  
- **TypeScript** — for type safety and better DX  
- **Framer Motion** — for smooth, expressive animations

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is not to launch a real agency, but to **practice layout structuring, animation tuning, and component design** using real-world patterns. It’s a sandbox for learning — and a portfolio piece that shows what’s possible when design meets code.
